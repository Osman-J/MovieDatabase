# MovieDatabase
This project was originally created by me on Repl.it but I've now transfered it over to GitHub.

# Project Description
MovieDatabase uses RESTfulAPIâ€™s and JavaScript to retrieve newly released movies and displays
information such as its trailer, synopsis, etc. in a stylish manner using HTML5 and CSS.

# SETUP
If you would like to clone this repository and play with the code there are a couple of things you must first do.
  1. Clone this repository if you haven't already.
  2. You must generate your own API KEY on https://www.themoviedb.org/
  3. Once you have your API KEY, simply paste it in "details.js" and "script.js" in the variable named "API_KEY"
  4. Have Fun!
